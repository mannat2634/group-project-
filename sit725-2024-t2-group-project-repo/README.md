-Slide 1:
Lady and gentleman, welcome to my idea!

-Slide 2:
First of all, let's me introduce myself. My name is Minh Tho Duong. I am a final year student studying the Data Science major. During my university time, I have some questions about expanding networking with useful people and find interesting friends.

-Slide 3:
--Actually, do you know that social media play important roles in human networking; and most of us usually have multiple accounts, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, WhatsApp, etc. I am aiming to create a webpage which allow us to customise the way we want to introduce ourselves. Having the QR code, people can easily scan and connect to our favourite social media networks.

-Slide 4:
--The project has some particular values. Let's have a look at some simple conversations. As we can see, people may be confused to connect with us on the Internet. That's why we want to bring incredible technologies to attract and enhance our connections.

-Slide 5:
--The project targets to a Pass level. In that, we will build a simple and convenient application which allow users to personalise their social media information professionally.

-Slide 6:
--Finally, I am excited to form a team and work with you. Thanks for listening!
